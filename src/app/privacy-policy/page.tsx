          We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under

          including, but not limited to, by denying goods or services, charging

        <p>
          To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
          verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in
          this document. For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that
          we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights
          by making a verifiable request which must:
        </p>
        <ul className="py-4">
          <li>
            provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative
          </li>
          <li>
            describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2 mb-3">
          We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
          identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our
          possession actually relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer
          request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use
          any personal information collected from you in connection with the
          verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification
          and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it
          longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for
          unrelated purposes. If you cannot personally submit a verifiable
          request, you can authorize a person registered with the California
          Secretary of State to act on your behalf. If you are an adult, you can
          make a verifiable request on behalf of a child under your parental
          authority. You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period
          of 12 months.
        </p>

          How and when we are expected to handle your request
        </span>
        <p>
          We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and
          provide information about how we will process your request. We will
          respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need
          more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more
          time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90
          days to fulfill your request. Our disclosure(s) will cover the
          preceding 12-month period. Only with regard to personal information
          collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request
          that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will
          provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve
          a disproportionate effort. Should we deny your request, we will
          explain you the reasons behind our denial. We do not charge a fee to
          process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is
          manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a
          reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we
          will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
